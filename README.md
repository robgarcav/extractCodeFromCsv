#Java BSH extractor from XML files
##Description
The program is made to clone a directory structure and extract Java code from XML files for processing as sources independantly.

##Integration with SonarQube
This is not possible yet as long as it's needed to compile the code resolving the dependancies which is not viable at this time.
